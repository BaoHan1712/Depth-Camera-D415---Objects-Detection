## Introduction
This guide provides an overview of how to use a depth camera with the main.py script. The depth camera is a device that captures 3D information of the environment, allowing for applications such as object detection, tracking, and 3D reconstruction.

## Hardware Requirements
- Depth camera (e.g. Intel RealSense, Kinect)
- Computer with compatible operating system (Windows, Linux, macOS)

## Software Requirements
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV library
- Depth camera SDK (if required)

## Setup and Installation
1. Install the required software and libraries.
2. Connect the depth camera to the computer.
3. Follow the manufacturer's instructions to install the depth camera SDK (if required).

## Basic Usage
1. Run the main.py script.
2. The script will capture and display the depth image from the camera.
3. Use the keyboard or mouse to interact with the image (e.g. zoom, pan).

## Advanced Usage
1. Modify the main.py script to suit your specific needs (e.g. object detection, tracking).
2. Use the depth camera's API to access advanced features (e.g. 3D reconstruction).

## Troubleshooting
- Check the camera connection and power supply.
- Ensure the software and libraries are up-to-date.
- Consult the manufacturer's documentation and online resources for further assistance.
